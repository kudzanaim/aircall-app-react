# The app has the following funcitonality:

Activity Feed - simple list of calls
Activity Detail - detail of a call
Archive - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
